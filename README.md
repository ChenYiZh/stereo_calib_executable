## How to Run
1.  print out "acircles_pattern.png" and stick it to a rigid surface, make it a "calibration board".
2.  run "stereo_calib.exe"ï¼Œ and you will see the image from left and right camera.
3.  place the "calibration board" in front of the camera, press "c" on the key board to capture an image pair(a blue flash appera with success capture). try to capture around 10 pair of the "calibration board" with different angle orientation and distance, try to cover the whole field of view of the cameras.  you can watch a video sample here. the captured image pairs is list in /save_image/ folder.
